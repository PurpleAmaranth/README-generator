  ## README-generator
  
  ## Description

  README files are helpful to projects because they are the main source for describing what an app is for, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions to the project.

  With this app you can quickly and easily create a README file by using the command-line to generate one.

  This program creates a README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).
